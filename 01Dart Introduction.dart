//Dart is a clent optimized programing language for apps on multiple platform  developed by google use for bulding mobile,web,desktop,server

//Dart come with 2 compilation processes compilation mean the porocess of translating sourcecode the code we type in to machine code is basically converting human readable format to the format which the computer can understand
//2 compilation process are 
//JIT(just in time):During development Dart uses theJIT compiler which allows for fast iteration  and immediate feedback it means u can make changes to your code and see the result without waiting for a link the compilation
//AOT(Ahead of time):when its time to deploy app u can use the aot compiler the aot compiler compiles your dart code into your optimized native machine code the result in faster execution and improved performance making your application really  efficient

//To write dart code we need SDK(Software Develoment Kit)
//SDK:In Flutter, the Flutter SDK is a toolkit provided by Google that includes everything you need to build, test, and run Flutter apps.
//Why is it Important?
// Without the Flutter SDK, you canâ€™t create or run Flutter apps. It gives you the full environment to build cross-platform apps from a single codebase
void main() {
  //here void is return type that doesnt return any value (execution starts here )
  //There are many return type like int,String,List,Bool
  //Return types: In Dart, functions can return a value of a specific type. The return type is specified after the function's name and parameters, separated by a colon. For example:

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
//In this example, the add() function returns an int value. If a function does not return a value, its return type is void.
  print('hello');
  //used to display output
//Keyword:keyword are basically special word that carry special meaning in dart or other programing language
  
  //comments is also called non executable code/statement  use for explanatory mark
  //two type of comment   1)single line comments(start with //)
  //   2)multi line commments(start with /*   endwith */)
}
